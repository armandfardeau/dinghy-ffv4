Contributing
Thank you for considering contributing to this website

You can contribute in the following ways:

Finding and reporting bugs
Contributing code by fixing bugs or implementing features

Bug reports
Bug reports and feature suggestions can be submitted to GitHub Issues. Please make sure that you are not submitting duplicates, and that a similar report or request has not already been resolved or rejected in the past using the search function. Please also use descriptive, concise titles.

Pull requests
Please use clean, concise titles for your pull requests. We use commit squashing, so the final commit in the master branch will carry the title of the pull request.

The smaller the set of changes in the pull request is, the quicker it can be reviewed and merged. Splitting tasks into multiple smaller pull requests is often preferable.
