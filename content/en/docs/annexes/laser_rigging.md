## Prepare the sail

1. Place the material on a flat surface and check that you are not missing any parts
2. Unroll the sail
3. Thread the mast bottom and top in the axis, the two arrows must be aligned
4. Slide the sail on the mast, the tack must be on the axis of the arrows and the mullet screw
5. Put the battens in their respective places, the smallest on top.
6. Check the alignment of the sail on the mast, a twist will damage both the sail and the mast, this can lead to premature wear.
7. Insert the boom into the gooseneck screw
8. Put the spar between the boom and the clew
9. Put the vang between the boom and the lower mast, usually it is fixed to the boom with a metal piece that fits and to the boom with a shackle or a broken ring
10. 10. Attach the edge hook to the clew and hold it under tension with a small release key.
11. Tie the cunnigham to the vang support with a bowline knot

## Prepare the steering appendages

1. Put the rudder in place, taking care of the metal tab
2. Thread the tiller through the metal rudder bracket under the aft end of the bridle (the one without the knot)
3. Thread the pin through the hole
4. Pass the rudder shaft through the clam cleat.

## Set the sail

1. Turn the laser into the wind
2. Slide the mast into the hole provided for this purpose, taking care not to make it rub on the hole's crack
3. Pass the edge line through the pulley at the foot of the mast and through the cleat on the plate.
4. Make drop keys to shorten the tip (this can be used to determine the maximum setting)
5. Pass the cunningham through the tack then through the sheave and then through the cleat on the plate.
6. Make release keys to shorten the tip

## Set up the sheeting system

1. Pass the sheet through the block located in the cockpit
2. Make sure that the sheet circuit is in the right direction, i.e. the one that emits a resistance (so it will not resist when you board)
3. Pass the sheet through the first pulley on the boom from the mast, then through the grey strap and then through the last pulley
4. Pass the sheet through the block located on the crow's foot in a backward direction towards the front
5. Pass the sheet through the ringot and tie a figure eight knot to stop it (Two are sometimes necessary in strong winds)

## After the launch

1. Pull on the rudder tip to bring it down completely and lock it to the clam cleat
2. Apply 2 keys in front of the clam cleat to prevent it from rising
3. Pass the elastic hook through the handle
