## Before starting the engine
### Do a check-up of the boat

- All lines are coiled and stowed.
- No lines are dragging in the water.
- Hull plugs are closed.
- Moorings are securely stowed.

### Check the engine

- The feeder is full and connected to the engine. The vent (small opening on the fuel cap allowing air to enter) is open.
- The fuel supply is clear (no knots, pinching of the hose...)
- The circuit breaker is in place.
- Locate the engine lowering system.
- Wet the engine.
- Check that you are in neutral.

## Start the engine

- Pump with the bulb on the fuel line until it is hard.
- Grasp the starter and pull gently until you feel a slight resistance.
- Then pull hard to start the engine. Follow the launcher as it rewinds.
- Play with the throttle/choke if necessary. Check that the engine is cooled: it spits out a small stream of water. If not, check that the strainer, usually located near the propeller, is clear. If necessary, stop the motor.

### Causes of failure

- You have flooded the engine: disconnect the fuel supply, restart 2 to 3 times. The engine will usually restart at this point. Reconnect the fuel supply.
- You have not pumped, there is no fuel: pump, refuel
- Shift gears when the engine is at low speed.
- No slip point for the clutch: shift gears firmly.
- Pause in neutral before shifting from forward to reverse and vice versa.

### Stop the engine

- Press the red button on the kill switch.
- If it doesn't work: remove the circuit breaker.
- If it doesn't work: remove the fuel supply, let the engine stall.

The engine should always be started before releasing the boot or raising the main anchor. Even for an intervention, and especially in this case, be rigorous in the check-up and stowage of the boat: if you leave with an unstowed boat, you run the risk of being impeded during your intervention.

**Tidy up the boat before leaving it: it will always be ready**.
