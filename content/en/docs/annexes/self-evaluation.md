This is the evaluation framework of the **Fédération Française de Voile**.

It is important to take your time and move on to the next level when you have mastered the previous one perfectly because the steps are designed to be consistent with the learning progression. **But keep in mind that this is only a guide, and everyone progresses differently.**

Be humble, there is no point in working on regatta strategies if you don't know how to do a tack and master the exit angle, going backwards can allow you to "back up to jump" and ultimately make your progress faster.
