## Lateral marks
The side markers are used to mark the channels reserved for sailboats and boats. **Their direction is always given for a vehicle coming from the open sea to the harbor.

### Classic channel

* Any green, conical-shaped marker should be left to starboard when entering the harbor.
* Any red markings, cylindrical in shape, should be left to port when entering the harbor.

Mnemonic: "When entering the harbor, I wear a green knit and two so-red socks".

### Favorite Channel

If a channel splits, the side channel marks have an additional horizontal striped band.

## Cardinals

Cardinals are used to mark a hazard. It's important to look at the chart to determine the exact nature of the hazard and how to deal with it effectively.

A cardinal marker indicates the safe area in relation to the hazard
**Example**: A south cardinal marker is placed south of the hazard, so you must pass south of it to avoid it.

The color marking corresponds to the points of the cardinal:

* North: Black band at the top
* South: Black band at the bottom
* East: Black stripes at the top and bottom
* West: Black band in the center

We can draw the outline of the cardinal tag's indicator to determine its type. **W** indicates West, E indicates **East**.

Be careful at low tide with turret or pole beacons: **it is possible that the high water mark will lead one to think of a black band**.

## Other marks
### Isolated danger
This marker indicates a hazard of limited extent. It is placed on or near the hazard.

### Safe Waters
This marker signals that there is no danger around it. It can be seen at the entrance to channels or at sea as a marker for a traffic separation scheme.

### Near Beach Marker
This marker indicates an area subject to special regulations. We can mention the buoys near the coast: 300m zone, exit and entry channels for beach equipment, ...

### Serious New Hazard
This mark identifies hazards that are not yet marked on the maps.
The new hazard is indicated by a combination of **2 laterals**, or **2 cardinals** very close together (20 meters...).
In this case, the marks keep their meaning. Their doubling can
