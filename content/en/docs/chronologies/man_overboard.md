# Man overboard

## General
Recovering a HLM is not a trivial task under any circumstances.

The mass of a laser with its crew is around 150 kg. Even at a few knots, on the head of a person in the water the shock can be fatal. If the HLM has fallen into the water conscious you will want to recover it consciously.

The HLM is a maneuver to be adapted according to the conditions, it will be necessary to adapt, you will be the only judge.
In any case, think before you act. Being ill-prepared and having to turn around again takes more time than stalling for a few seconds to be sure.
Rehearse this maneuver often, as it is important for its proper execution.

As soon as you realize that there is an HLM: you do not leave it of the eyes and slow down.

## Manoeuvre : the luffing line
You have to arrive at the LHM at the right speed. This is the only speed that guarantees :

- A margin of maneuver in case of a wind shift (you have the windward and the leeward)
- A possibility to sail at low speed while remaining maneuverable
- A possibility of stopping quickly

We recover the HLM to the wind:

- We see it better
- One will not drift on him

Disadvantage: we drift faster than him! To take it into account

- It is necessary to be able to recover the HLM by "stretching" the arm. It is thus a question of aiming at it. Be careful if you loff or shoot at him: the turning radius is not zero.

During the entire maneuver, gybing is avoided to prevent over-accidents.

1. We turn or we shoot down around the HLM in order to come down to the drop.
2. We move away from the HLM by leaving it on our side, we take advantage of it to reassure it and to note if it is conscious.
3. We turn to establish ourselves full, we avoid gybing. If you are low enough, you can luff or drop to adjust the trajectory.
4. You approach to get to the full boat, windward target within arm's reach, zero speed. You must anticipate the drift and act quickly.

- If the HLM is conscious, prepare a piece of resalage to give him if you can't get him back.
- Reassembling it often requires help. A HLM weighs its own weight plus the weight of its wet clothes: help it with its vest which should allow you to grab it by the shoulder straps.
- Once on board: do a "health" check: cold, fear, ... Do not hesitate to return or take a break.
