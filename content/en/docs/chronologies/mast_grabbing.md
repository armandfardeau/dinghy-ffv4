# Taking the mast

In some cases (crew too light and tired, need to go fast...) it is necessary to help a boat to resalt by lifting its mast from the water.

This maneuver is quite technical and usually reserved for the instructor.

Poorly executed, it can become dangerous. Before attempting it, be sure you know how to stop at a specific point.

- Depending on the position of the desalinated boat, arrive so that it finishes its maneuver facing the wind.
- Aim for 1 meter below the masthead (beware of drift and waves: a mast and your head do not mix well in strong chop).
- Arrive at a very low speed, at the right height, with the mainsail completely shocked.
- Once you have the masthead in hand, visualize the trajectory of the mast when it leaves: it must not get stuck.
- Give an upward impulse.
- As soon as the boat has resurfaced move away a little, it is possible to stabilize it by holding it by the nose in the case of the laser.
