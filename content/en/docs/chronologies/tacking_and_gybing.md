Tacking and gybing are the basic dinghy maneuvers. We differentiate between classic maneuvers and rocking maneuvers. Tilting is an exaggeration of what is done naturally in strong winds. All you have to do is reproduce this movement.

## Tacking
The tack is a strategic maneuver in dinghy sailing, it can make you lose or gain places. Often during a wind shift, the correct execution of a tack can give you an advantage over your competitors.

There are two types of tack: the classic tack and the tilted tack, the latter being reserved for lighter winds. The tacking technique must be adjusted according to the wind, a good training on this maneuver is always worthwhile.

### Classic Tack
On this video we can see **Marit Bouwmeester**, several times world champion and Olympic gold medalist illustrating the tacking technique.

2. Choose your moment to tack
3. Push back the helm
4. Lift your leg over the backstrap
5. Push the bar
6. Go under the boom and ease the sheet
7. Change hands

### Tilt tack
The rocker tack allows you to tack in light winds.

1. Use either body weight (heel) or bar to loft
2. Pass the leg (back) over the back strap
3. Use body weight to counter heel sharply
3. Pass under the boom and ease the sheet
4. Reposition yourself on the other side of the boat and bring it back to a flat position with one stroke
5. Trim the sheet

## Gybing
The gybe is a maneuver often feared by the beginner, it requires commitment and does not forgive mistakes. Often, too much counter-heeling or too much ryhtmic roll results in a dive. Good coordination in this maneuver allows you to take advantage of it.

### Classic gybing
On this video we can see **Nick Thompson**, two times world champion.

1. Look behind you
2. Overbend a little to keep the tension in the mainline
3. Lower the sail and watch for the sail's passage point
4. Give a little push to the counter heel to make the sail pass and pull the sheet to avoid it getting stuck in the transom (flushing)
5. 5. Quickly move to the other side and level the boat.
6. Change hands.

### Tilt gybe
The tilt gybe allows you to maintain speed in a light wind.

1. Look behind you
2. Overbend the sheet a little to keep it taut
3. Force the counter heel to bring it down at once
4. Give the counter-heel a little push to make the sail go through
5. Pull the sheet to prevent it from getting stuck in the transom (flushing) while passing back over the sail.
6. Se replacer rapidement de l'autre côté et remettre le bateau à plat d'un coup.
7. Changer de mains
