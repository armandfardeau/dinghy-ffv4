# ⚖️ Dinghy Mechanics

The objective of this chapter is to understand the main mechanisms that allow a dinghy to sail.

The mechanics of the dinghy is actually a complex science requiring significant mathematical knowledge. Important "shortcuts" will be made in order to get to the point.

In all that follows, we consider a dinghy that moves forward at a uniform speed with no change in heel/pitch/roll.

## Definitions

A sail is "cut" into several areas that have specific names.
A sail is a surface in 3 dimensions.

A profile is a section of the sail along the mast.

The profile of the sail changes with height but also with trim.
