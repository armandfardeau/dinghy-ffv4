# The balances

## Static balances

### The center of gravity
{{< columns >}}
The drifter has a center of gravity noted {{< katex >}}CG{{< /katex >}}, like any object entering the field of attraction of a planet, point of application of Newton's force: Gravity.

This force is exerted vertically from top to bottom.

If we take the dinghy alone (without its crew), its center of gravity is invariable whatever the position of the boat.

On the other hand, once its crew is on board, this center of gravity can be modified according to the position of the navigator(s).
<--->
{{< figure src="../images/cg.png" title="Center of gravity" >}}
{{< /columns >}}
{{<hint info>}}It can also vary depending on how much water has entered the boat during navigation.{{< /hint >}}

### The center of hull

{{< columns >}}
{{< figure src="../images/cc.png" title="Centerline" >}}
<--->
The hull center {{< katex >}}CC{{< /katex >}} of a dinghy is the center of gravity of its submerged part.

At the center of the hull, Archimedes' thrust applies.

It is exerted vertically from bottom to top.
{{< /columns >}}
The center of buoyancy varies according to the boat's inclination to the water, its heel, its pitch, or its sinkage into the water.

### Desalting

{{< columns >}}
In the lateral stability of the dinghy, gravity and buoyancy form a pair of
forces.
<--->
{{< figure src="../images/dessalage.png" title="Desalting" >}}
{{< /columns >}}
A capsized boat is likely to capsize because of this force couple called here capsizing torque.

{{< columns >}}
{{< figure src="../images/ressalage.png" title="Ressalage" >}}
<--->
{{< /columns >}}
If I stand on the centerboard of my boat, I shift my center of gravity and the conjunction of forces this time forms a righting torque.

### Dynamic equilibrium

 Downwind balance
{{< columns >}}
Lateral balance downwind is often tricky.

At issue is the force couple created by the aerodynamic force {{< katex >}}Fa{{< /katex >}} and the resistance of the hull {{< katex >}}Fr{{< /katex >}}.
<--->
{{< figure src="../images/va.png" title="Balancing in a tailwind" >}}
{{< /columns >}}
{{< hint info >}}To eliminate this torque, on round-hulled dinghies, a slight counter-heel is preferred so that the point of application of the aerodynamic force and that of the hull drag align and balance the boat.{{< /hint >}}

 Balance under other points of sail

### Flat boat
{{< columns >}}
{{< figure src="../images/fb.png" title="Balance of the flat boat" >}}
<--->
Let's assume that gravity, buoyancy, aero and hydrodynamic forces, and hull drag all act in the same vertical plane.

We therefore assume that there is no problem of lateral trim.
{{< /columns >}}
{{<hint info>}}If the point of application of the buoyant thrust is aft of the anti-drift force, the sailboat luffs because it is fiery.{{< /hint >}}

{{< columns >}}
Conversely, it will sink if the velocity force is on the front (the boat is slack).
principle that windsurfers use among other things to control their direction.
<--->
{{< figure src="../images/fb2.png" title="Balancing the boat flat" >}}
{{< /columns >}}

Reversing or advancing the centerboard is possible in dinghies thanks to:
 The forward or backward movement of the mast
 Adjusting the mast rake
 The modification of the boat's pitch (forward or backward movement of the crew)
 Adjusting the sail draft

### Heeled boat
{{< columns >}}
With heel, in the dinghy's lateral balance, the luffing torque between the velocity force and the hull resistance increases (note: The anti-drift force also accentuates the heel). If my boat is luffing, this luffing reduces the incidence of wind on the sails (the velocity force) and my boat will then level out on its own.
<--->
{{< figure src="../images/nfb.png" title="Heeled boat" >}}
{{< /columns >}}
{{< hint info >}}On the other hand, counter-heeling offers a torque that brings the dinghy down. Hence the importance of sailing a flat boat to avoid course corrections with the helm, which slows the boat down enormously. {{< /hint >}}

If in light weather, it is better to have a little heel, it is to help the sails position themselves correctly.
