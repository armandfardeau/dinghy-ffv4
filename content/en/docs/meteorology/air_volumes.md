# Air masses
Here are the main air masses found in Western Europe that shape the weather we have.

## Definition of a stable and unstable air mass

In the atmosphere, air that rises or sinks because it is forced to do so is said to be unstable.
If it does not move vertically, or only slightly, it is said to be stable. Thus, if we heat air, its tendency will be to rise, it becomes unstable. It remains unstable as long as its
temperature is higher than that of its environment. As soon as its temperature reaches that of its environment, it stops rising.

**From your deductions, describe a stable and unstable air mass**
{{< details title="Answer">}}
When the ground is heated by the Sun, the layers closest to the ground are warmed and since the warm air is less dense, the warmed air will tend to rise.
If the pocket of warm air cools less quickly than the surrounding air, this parcel of air will accelerate upwards. We are then in the presence of an unstable air mass.

In the opposite case, the rising air becomes colder than the surrounding air, the upward movement will stop and the atmosphere is then stable.
