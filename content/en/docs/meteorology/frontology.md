# Frontology

## The front
A front is a region of the troposphere constituting a dynamic and thermal transition zone between two air masses with different characteristics (Source: Météo-France).

A front is a surface of discontinuity (transition zone) where two air masses with different properties confront each other.
There are different types of fronts:

- warm fronts,
- cold fronts,
- occluded fronts,
- stationary fronts.

Stationary fronts form when two air masses with different characteristics meet but have no flow toward each other.

## Creating a disturbance

{{< figure caption="Creating a disruption" src="../images/disruption.png" >}}
**Step 1 and 2:** warm air from the south and cold air from the north meet. The air masses do not mix, the system begins to roll up: this is the birth of the warm and cold fronts.

**Stage 3:** the system begins to turn counterclockwise. The warm air is trapped by the cold air.

**Step 4:** Trapped between the two cold air masses, the warm air is rejected at altitude: this is the beginning of the occlusion. The fact of turning will create a depression associated with the disturbance. At the end of the life of a disturbance, the air masses amalgamate and/or no longer become sufficiently different to maintain the fronts: this is frontolysis.
