# General Circulation

## Explanation of temperature differences on earth

The sun provides almost all of our energy.

The energy balance of the Earth is zero: the Earth sends back into space all the energy it receives.

However, the energy received by the Earth is not uniform depending on the latitude.

The equator receives more energy than the poles. This will create warmer and colder areas. The warm air masses will rise (ascending zone) and the cold air masses will descend (subsiding zone) because of their thermal properties.

This creates convection cells.

## Convection cells

On a planetary scale, there are several convection cells that govern meteorology. There are three main ones:

- Hadley cell
- Ferrel cell
- polar cell.

However, the direction of motion of these air masses is modified by the presence of the Coriolis force. The latter is due to the rotation of the Earth on its axis: any particle moving in a fluid (air or water for example) undergoes it.

It depends on the latitude and the speed of the particle.

- The further the particle is from the equator, the more intense the Coriolis force is.
- The greater the speed of the particle, the more intense the Coriolis force.

This force tends to move the particle to its right in the northern hemisphere (and to its left in the southern hemisphere). Without this force, there would be only one cell per hemisphere.
