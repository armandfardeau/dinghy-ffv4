Very often, the cloud structure of a disturbance allows you to distinguish several parts. The head is located in front of the disturbance.
The body corresponds closely to the fronts. The warm sector is the warm air trapped between the warm and cold fronts.

Finally, the trail is located behind the cold front.
Quite often, the low-pressure center can be isolated on satellite photographs, by a less important presence of cloudy masses.

## Passage of a "typical" disturbance on the Breton coast
### View from above
{{< figure caption="Schematic low-pressure system seen from above" src="../images/sky-view-depression.jpg" >}}
The clouds associated with the depression are in order:

1. Cirrus (**CI**) and Cirostatus (**CS**)
2. Altostratus (**As**)
3. Nimbostratus (**Ns**)
4. Stratocumulus (**Sc**) and Stratus (**St**)
5. Cumulonimbus (**Cb**)
6. Altocumulus (**Ac**) and Altostratus (**As**)
7. Cumulus (**Cu**)

### Diagram of the passage of a disturbance
{{< figure caption="Passage of fronts" src="../images/fronts-passage.jpg" >}}
For an observer placed on the right of the diagram, the cloud ceiling will subside and become darker and darker accompanied by heavy rain.
Then, in a second time, it will clear and give way to a sky filled with stratocumulus or stratus clouds as well as some showers.
This respite will be short-lived and will give way to strong winds and violent showers as the cumulonimbus passes. Thunderstorms are possible.
The situation will then improve to give way to the trailing sky with some squalls and clearings.
