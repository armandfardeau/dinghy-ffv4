# The weather report

In order to help the sailor know what the weather will be like, each country is required to have a weather service. MétéoFrance issues weather reports on a regular basis (see MétéoFranceMarine Guide).

There are 4 types of bulletins according to the type of activity: shore, coast, open sea and open sea. The coastal bulletin is the one we are interested in. This bulletin is issued by a CROSS three times a day by VHF.

It is also available on the Internet. The structure is always the same:

- WSB notice: in case of difficult weather conditions (Force 7 or more for a coastal bulletin).
- General situation: barometric situation on a region of about 1500km wide.
- Forecast (for the day or night depending on the time of issue) :
  - Wind: direction/force/possible trend
  - Sea
  - Swell
  - Weather
  - Visibility

- Forecast for the next day
- Future trend
- Observed weather at different locations in the area of validity of the bulletin
- Date and time of the next bulletin

When taking a written bulletin, since the flow is important, consider a pre-filled sheet and use abbreviations.
