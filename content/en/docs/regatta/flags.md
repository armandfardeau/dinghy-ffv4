# Regatta flags

The race committee symbolizes one end of the starting line - on land or at sea. The orange flag indicates that the line is anchored. A buoy establishes the other end.

From one regatta to another, the duration of the starting procedure may vary. Most often, it is a countdown in minutes.

The race committee will conduct the starting procedure using flags and sound signals, in accordance with the "Instructions of Sailing" (IC) which must be broadcast to all.

## Typical 5 minute procedure (simplified)
