# Main rules

## Helm privileges

### Rule 10 - Starboard tack priority
{{< columns >}}
{{< figure caption="The sailboat in black shall not force the white to maneuver" src="../images/tribord.png" >}}
<--->
When two sailboats pass each other while sailing in opposite directions, the one on starboard tack (receiving the wind from starboard) has priority. The sailboat on the port tack must then maneuver so as not to interfere with the other.

### Rule 11 - Leeward Priority
{{< columns >}}
{{< figure caption="The windward sailboat shall not interfere with the leeward sailboat" src="../images/sous-vent.png" >}}
<--->
When two sailboats are under the same tack and their trajectories converge, the priority belongs to the leeward sailboat. The windward sailboat must not generate the trajectory of the leeward sailboat or force it to maneuver.

On the other hand, the leeward sailboat may not interfere with the windward sailboat **beyond the upwind**.

## Other rules
### Rule 14 - Avoiding Contact

Participants shall avoid contact if reasonably possible, however a yacht in priority :

- need not act to avoid contact until it is clear that the other will not.
- must be exonerated if it violates this rule and the contact causes no damage or injury.

### Rule 15 - Acquiring the right of way
A yacht when acquiring the right of way must allow time and space for the other to keep clear. Unless it acquires the right of way due to an action on its part.

### Rule 42 - Propulsion rule

Any means of propulsion other than wind and water are prohibited.
