Depending on the technology of the boats, there are more or less settings. Some of them have more or less important actions on the smooth running of the boat. In light sailing, the most important adjustment is the position of the crew.

There are three types of adjustments:

* Static: which cannot be changed once on the water, or with difficulty.
* The dynamic ones: which often depend on the conditions and the speed
* Crew position: which also depends on the conditions and the speed

There are no universal settings.
