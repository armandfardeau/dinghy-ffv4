On the laser, only the choice of sail (Standard, Radial or 4.7) is a static setting, everything else is a dynamic setting.

On other dinghy supports, it is possible to **reef the sail**. This consists of reducing the surface area of a sail by folding it in part: the objective is to adapt the sail surface to the wind force when it strengthens and to lower the center of velic thrust. A sailboat that carries the canvas of time is more maneuverable, safer and often faster than a sailboat that carries too much.
