title: Passing a reef
weight: 3
---

A reef is an increase in the actual wind. This chart can be taken the other way around for the passage of a squall (but we try to avoid them). A strengthening wind (while remaining stable in direction) makes the apparent wind increase. The boat's objective is to take the most direct route.

Increasing force:

* You **shock** a little - You **maintain** the course - **bends**.
* If the true wind is too strong, the **apparent wind (will) give way** without being able to hold the boat and one must then **loaf or shock**.

Variable in direction:

* Wind that **gives**: one **luffs** in order to follow the wind.
* Wind that **refuses**: we **maintain** the current heading for a few seconds (gain to the wind thanks to inertia) then we **shock** to find the optimal speed.

To reduce the lengthening of the course, it is preferable **to follow the changes** of wind (adonnant or refusant) with the sheets.

Increasing force:

* We **keep** the setting and **lower**.

Variable in direction:

* Wind that **refuses**: one **shuts down** right away.
* Wind that **gives**: we **keep** the current heading for a few seconds (gain downwind thanks to inertia) then we **lofe** to find the optimal speed.
