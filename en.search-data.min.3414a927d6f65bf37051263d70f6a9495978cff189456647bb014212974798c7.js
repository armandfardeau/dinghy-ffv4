The warm air having a lower density than the cold air, is forced to rise above the cold air. Unlike the cold front, the passage between the two air masses takes place over a long distance and it is sometimes difficult to note the exact moment of its passage. The approach of such a front is marked by an invasion of high cirrus clouds, which gradually increase in thickness and turn into altostratus. Then the cloud becomes nimbostratus and gives continuous precipitation.\nStable warm front #  Main clouds :\n Cirrus Cirrostratus Altocumulus Altostratus Nimbostratus Stratocumulus Stratus    Stable Warm Front\n  Unstable warm front #  Main clouds :\n Cirrus Cirrostratus Altocumulus Altostratus Cumulonimbus Nimbostratus Stratus    Unstable Warm Front\n  Cold Front #  There are several types of cold fronts.

The sheet is used to adjust the angle of the sail in relation to the wind, it is the one that ensures the propulsion of the sailboat. It is used to propel the sailboat. It is trimmed upwind and trimmed downwind.\n To trim upwind:  we observe the sail\u0026rsquo;s flutter, as soon as it appears, we trim a little to erase it.

When the boom is almost at the transom angle and we continue to trim, the sheet exerts a vertical tension bringing the boom block in contact with the bridle block.

There are two main categories of sailing regattas: the \u0026ldquo;fleet regatta\u0026rdquo;, the most common, and the \u0026ldquo;match racing\u0026rdquo;, where only two boats compete. We will not deal with the latter.\nThe term regatta is semantically imprecise because it can refer (as the dictionary does) to a single isolated race (i.e., the period when a boat is racing as defined in the RRS) or to a set of races sailed in a continuous period (a day, a weekend, etc.). If the period is discontinuous, according to the RRS [see RRS A9], it is a series.\nThe regatta may take place on a closed (or constructed) course. The finish area is close to the start area, and the number of upwind legs is (ideally) equal to the number of downwind legs. It can also take place on an open course (raid over several races). The number of upwind and downwind races is balanced. [cf : Guide de la r√©gate Inters√©rie]\nLong distance offshore competitions are not designated as regattas but as offshore races.\nCourse #  The most commonly used course is called the \u0026ldquo;banana course\u0026rdquo;: it consists of a starting line perpendicular to the wind (i.e., the start is upwind, and requires sailing) and a buoy in line with the wind. A five-minute countdown is given and then the boats start on top.\nThey must then go around the windward buoy, leaving it to port, and then eventually a \u0026ldquo;dog leg\u0026rdquo; buoy.\nThe boats complete a specified number of laps before crossing the finish line.\nThere are many other courses such as the \u0026ldquo;coastal\u0026rdquo; course (a large course delimited by natural obstacles or navigation buoys), the \u0026ldquo;trapeze\u0026rdquo; course or the \u0026ldquo;Olympic\u0026rdquo; course etc.\nbanana course   Banana course with 2 leeward buoys and crosswind finish\n     Banana course with 1 leeward buoy and beam finish\n     Banana course with 1 leeward buoy and upwind finish\n    Olympic Triangle   Olympic Triangle\n   Regatta Grades #  The purpose of the grading is to determine a hierarchy of competitions according to their degree of sporting value (level of participants, notoriety and size of the competition).\nThe most common level in our sailing clubs is grade 5.\nLes diff√©rents grades sont: Grade ¬´ Ev√®nementiel L\u0026rsquo;Extra Grade est un grade dit ¬´ √©v√©nementiel ¬ª compos√© des comp√©titions de prestige organis√©es en France.\nIl rassemble les √©v√®nements majeurs en ¬ª Voile et Aventure ¬ª, en ¬´ Volves classiques ¬ª et ¬ª Voiliers de Tradition ¬ª en flotte et en solitaire, en Voile Olympique, Voile l√©g√®re, Habitable et Match Racing.\nChaque comp√©tition de l\u0026rsquo;Extra Grade se verra attribuer un grade sportif allant de W √† 3.\nGrade W Les comp√©titions de Grade W comprennent les Championnats du Monde de Classe Olympique et de Match Racing ainsi que des Classes ¬´ Haut Niveau ¬ª Habitacle (incluant la Voie de Tradition), Funboard et Kiteboard.Grade 1 Les comp√©titions de grade 1 comprennent les comp√©titions ¬´ majeures ¬ª √† participation intemationale, en Voile Olympique, Match Race et Classes ¬´ Haut Niveau ¬ª HabitableGrade 2 Les comp√©titions de grade 2 comprennent les comp√©titions √† participation internationale de Voie L√©g√®re, Match Racing et Habitable (incluant la Voile de Tradition) et les Championnats de France Elite.Grade 3 Les comp√©titions de grade 3 comprennent les Championnats de France des Classes et de pratiques et les Championnats de France Minimes et Espoirs, les comp√©titions ¬´ majeures ¬ª √† participation nationale ou internationale de Voile L√©g√®re, Match Racing et Habitable (incluant la Voile de Tradition).Grade 4 Les comp√©titions de grade 4 comprennent les Championnats de France Entreprise, National 2 et des F√©d√©rations Affinitaires, les comp√©titions √† participation nationale ou regroupant plusieurs Ligues d\u0026rsquo;un niveau sportif sup√©rieur aux Grades 5, en Voile L√©g√®re, Match Racing, et Habitable (incluant la Voile de Tradition).Grades 5A / 5B / 5C Les comp√©titions de Grades 5A, 5B et 5C comprennent les comp√©titions d√©di√©es aux couleurs de clubs, des coureurs d\u0026rsquo;un ou plusieurs d√©partements ou bassins et d\u0026rsquo;une ou plusieurs Ligues dont le niveau sportif est inf√©rieur au grade 4, en Voile L√©g√®re, Match Racing et Habitable (incluant la Voie de Tradition).\nLes comp√©titions de Grades 5 doivent permettre la promotion de la pratique comp√©titive conviviale, du plan local au plan r√©gional, en Voile L√©g√®re, Habitable (incluant la Voile de Tradition) et Match Racing.\nEn r√©sum√© :\n Grade 5C : pour les marins du Club mais ouvert √† tous Grade 5B : D√©partement Grade 5A : Ligue (R√©gion)   Theoretical course Level 4 FFV  Getting off to a good start   "});index.add({'id':9,'href':'/dinghy-ffv4/en/docs/chronologies/resalage/','title':"Resalage",'section':"Chronologies",'content':"Resalage #  Assessing the situation #  Desalting is not a trivial matter.

It is expressed in %.  Two air masses with different properties (temperatures and humidities) do not mix or mix only slightly. Depending on the temperature of the air mass, the maximum allowable amount of water vapor before saturation varies. This variation is represented by the Mollier diagram.

Even with a shallow draft, it is good to know where you can pass or not. This can allow you to make a short cut or to manage a sensitive channel.\nIt is imperative to remain critical of the calculations and verify them empirically. A frequent error is the inversion between rising and falling tide.\nTo know if it is possible to pass at a place, it is necessary to calculate the water height. To do this, you need:\n a chart (SHOM chart for example) a tide calendar for the place where you are sailing (Almanach du marin Breton for example)  The SHOM cannot calculate the tides for all the ports in France, so there are reference ports and attached ports. The latter depend on the reference ports with corrections in water height and in PM and BM time.\nBe careful with the following points:\n On tide calendars, the time rarely corresponds to local time. Pay attention to the reference height used in the tide calendar and on your chart. In France, the SHOM takes as reference the hydrographic zero (water height at BM coefficient 120). Note that for all coefficients, the water level at mid-tide is always the same.  The twelfths method #    Tidal sine curve\n   The tidal cycle in France is 2 tides per day, it can be represented by a sinusoidal.\nIn order to represent it more easily, we linearize the sine by distorting the time axis. Indeed, by changing the scale of the graph, the curve is now a straight line. This is the method of twelfths.\n  Before we start calculating, we need to find two things:\n The amplitude: Height at PM - Height at BM The tide time: Time between PM and BM / 6  For this, we cut a half cycle (from BM to PM for example) in twelfths, we consider that the sea rises or falls by :\n 1/12 of the amplitude during the 1st hour tide 2/12 of the amplitude during the 2nd hour tide * 3/12 of the amplitude during the **3rd hour tide 3/12 of the amplitude during the 3rd hour tide * 3/12 of the amplitude during the **4th hour tide 2/12 of the amplitude during the 5th hour tide * 1/12 of the amplitude during the **4th hour tide 1/12 of the amplitude during the 6th hour tide.  How to calculate the twelfths method on a graduated paper #  We will make a graph with the time in second on the abscissa and the water height on the ordinate.\nExample of calculation on graduated paper #   Low tide hour: 6h06 High tide hour: 12h12 Tide level at high tide: 6m40 Tide level at low tide: 3m10  That is:\n Tide time: (12h12 - 6h06) / 6 = 1h01 Amplitude: 6.40m - 3.10m = 3.30m    Tide calculation using a graduated paper and the twelfths method\n    6h06: 3,10m 7h07: 3,38m 8h08: 3,93m 9h09: 4,75m 10h10: 5,58m 11h11: 6,13m 12h12: 6,40m    It can be seen that the accuracy of the results depends on the accuracy of the grid cells, this method is to be preferred when you want to go fast and the accuracy of the calculation is not essential.\nHow to calculate the twelfths method with proportional ratios #  Example of calculation with proportional ratios #   Low water time: 10:38 High water hour: 17h09 Water level at High tide: 5,55m Water level at low tide: 2,50m  That is:\n Amplitude: 5.55 m - 2.50 m = 3.05 m Twelfth = Amplitude / 12 = 3.05 m / 12 = 0.254m  To find the water level at 12:12\n Let\u0026rsquo;s calculate the number of tidal hours between 10:38 and 12:12  In this time interval, 94 minutes pass.   We divide this time by the duration of 1 hour tide (here 65,17 min):  94 / 65,17 = 1,442 hours tide. There are therefore 1.442 hours of tide that pass between 10:38 and 12:12.   We take 1 tidal hour + 0.442 tidal hours:  or 1 twelfth + 2 twelfths x 0.442: 1.885 twelfths    Therefore:\n The sea has descended by 1.885 twelfths Multiplying by the value of the twelfth: 1.885 x 0.254 m = 0.48m  The sea has descended by 0.48m   By subtracting from the height of the MP:  5.55m - 0.48m = 5.07m    Result of the twelfths rule: At 12:12 PM, the tidal height is 5.07m\nTo find the time at which the water height will be 3.00m\n To go from 3.00m to 2.50m, the sea must go down 0.50m.

The center of hull #    Centerline    The hull center  (CC)  of a dinghy is the center of gravity of its submerged part.\nAt the center of the hull, Archimedes\u0026rsquo; thrust applies.\nIt is exerted vertically from bottom to top.\n  The center of buoyancy varies according to the boat\u0026rsquo;s inclination to the water, its heel, its pitch, or its sinkage into the water.\nDesalting #  In the lateral stability of the dinghy, gravity and buoyancy form a pair of forces.

If my boat is luffing, this luffing reduces the incidence of wind on the sails (the velocity force) and my boat will then level out on its own.    Heeled boat     On the other hand, counter-heeling offers a torque that brings the dinghy down. Hence the importance of sailing a flat boat to avoid course corrections with the helm, which slows the boat down enormously.

Wave length: distance between two crests of a wave train  Formation #    Birth of swell and waves\n    Creation of waves over the entirety of the world\u0026rsquo;s seas After the wind weakens or the waves spread outside the windy area, they spread freely, which is then called the swell    Modification of waves in the vicinity of the coast by the presence of the bottom; As soon as the sea depth is less than about twice the height of the waves, they break on the beach or shoals.\nThe height (from trough to crest) of a wave is a statistical height. Example: we take a series of 100 waves. On these 100 waves we keep only the 33 highest (the third). We average the height of these 33 waves and it is the \u0026ldquo;reference\u0026rdquo; height. It is sometimes noted H1/3.\nEnergy of the wave #    Wave displacement\n   When waves do not break, there is almost no horizontal displacement of water over a short space of time. They are waves (energy displacement).   Be careful when the wind and waves are opposite the current. This raises a chop that will quickly become dangerous. When calculating a tide, take waves/swells into account.\nLocal weather  Weather forecast  Weather Report   "});index.add({'id':45,'href':'/dinghy-ffv4/en/docs/meteorology/weather_report/','title':"Weather Report",'section':"Weather forecast",'content':"The weather report #  In order to help the sailor know what the weather will be like, each country is required to have a weather service. M√©t√©oFrance issues weather reports on a regular basis (see M√©t√©oFranceMarine Guide).\nThere are 4 types of bulletins according to the type of activity: shore, coast, open sea and open sea. The coastal bulletin is the one we are interested in. This bulletin is issued by a CROSS three times a day by VHF.\nIt is also available on the Internet. The structure is always the same:\n  WSB notice: in case of difficult weather conditions (Force 7 or more for a coastal bulletin).\n  General situation: barometric situation on a region of about 1500km wide.\n  Forecast (for the day or night depending on the time of issue) :\n Wind: direction/force/possible trend Sea Swell Weather Visibility    Forecast for the next day\n  Future trend\n  Observed weather at different locations in the area of validity of the bulletin\n  Date and time of the next bulletin\n  When taking a written bulletin, since the flow is important, consider a pre-filled sheet and use abbreviations.\nwaves and the swell  Weather forecast  Mod√®les m√©teo   "});index.add({'id':46,'href':'/dinghy-ffv4/en/icons-credits/','title':"Icons Credits",'section':"Theoretical course Level 4 FFV",'content':"google\nthose-icons\n"});})();
