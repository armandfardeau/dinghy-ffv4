Depending on the conditions, you can hurt (and scare) yourself.
As soon as you surface, check for any loose ends or other objects that may be in your way. Locate where you are on the water and the time available for resurfacing: rocks, other boat. If you feel that you do not have the time to right the boat in the face of danger, give priority to people over equipment.</description></item><item><title>Bearing away from the buoy</title><link>https://armandfardeau.github.io/dinghy-ffv4/en/docs/chronologies/abattee/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://armandfardeau.github.io/dinghy-ffv4/en/docs/chronologies/abattee/</guid><description>Chronology # Slaughtered at the Buoy

We differentiate between classic maneuvers and rocking maneuvers. Tilting is an exaggeration of what is done naturally in strong winds. All you have to do is reproduce this movement.
Tacking # The tack is a strategic maneuver in dinghy sailing, it can make you lose or gain places. Often during a wind shift, the correct execution of a tack can give you an advantage over your competitors.</description></item><item><title>Man overboard</title><link>https://armandfardeau.github.io/dinghy-ffv4/en/docs/chronologies/man_overboard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://armandfardeau.github.io/dinghy-ffv4/en/docs/chronologies/man_overboard/</guid><description>General # Recovering a HLM is not a trivial task under any circumstances.
The mass of a laser with its crew is around 150 kg. Even at a few knots, on the head of a person in the water the shock can be fatal. If the HLM has fallen into the water conscious you will want to recover it consciously.
The HLM is a maneuver to be adapted according to the conditions, it will be necessary to adapt, you will be the only judge.</description></item><item><title>Taking the mast</title><link>https://armandfardeau.github.io/dinghy-ffv4/en/docs/chronologies/mast_grabbing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://armandfardeau.github.io/dinghy-ffv4/en/docs/chronologies/mast_grabbing/</guid><description>In some cases (crew too light and tired, need to go fast&amp;hellip;) it is necessary to help a boat to resalt by lifting its mast from the water.
This maneuver is quite technical and usually reserved for the instructor.
Poorly executed, it can become dangerous. Before attempting it, be sure you know how to stop at a specific point.
Depending on the position of the desalinated boat, arrive so that it finishes its maneuver facing the wind.</description></item><item><title>Towing after a dismasting</title><link>https://armandfardeau.github.io/dinghy-ffv4/en/docs/chronologies/dematage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://armandfardeau.github.io/dinghy-ffv4/en/docs/chronologies/dematage/</guid><description>It happens that the dinghy dismasts, it can happen because of a mast breakage (on the laser at the sleeve) or because of a mast foot breakage. In any case, it is impressive and should not be taken lightly.
Preparation of the tow # The list of operations to perform (this list is not exhaustive):
Make sure all crew are okay. Check where the current is coming from. Set the grappling hook in operation.</description></item></channel></rss>
