A streamline is the materialization of the movement of the fluid in a flow.
There are 2 types of flows:
Laminar: the current lines are almost parallel to each other. Vortex: the current lines are totally disordered. The sails of a sports dinghy are most effective when the flow is laminar. It is highlighted by the penons and favors.

Aero force
The resultant force is applied at the maximum of the trough and is almost perpendicular to the chord (except for incidence angles below 25°).
Sail efficiency # Velic polar
The angles that run through the curve are those of the apparent wind relative to the sailboat&amp;rsquo;s course.</description></item><item><title>The balances</title><link>https://armandfardeau.github.io/dinghy-ffv4/en/docs/dinghy_mecanic/balance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://armandfardeau.github.io/dinghy-ffv4/en/docs/dinghy_mecanic/balance/</guid><description>Static balances # The center of gravity # The drifter has a center of gravity noted
\(CG\) , like any object entering the field of attraction of a planet, point of application of Newton's force: Gravity. This force is exerted vertically from top to bottom.
If we take the dinghy alone (without its crew), its center of gravity is invariable whatever the position of the boat.</description></item><item><title>Direct and indirect links</title><link>https://armandfardeau.github.io/dinghy-ffv4/en/docs/dinghy_mecanic/direct-indirect-links/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://armandfardeau.github.io/dinghy-ffv4/en/docs/dinghy_mecanic/direct-indirect-links/</guid><description>Direct links # mermaid.initialize({ "flowchart": { "useMaxWidth":true }, "theme": "default" } ) stateDiagram Helm -- Direction Sail -- Propulsion Weight -- Balance The helm affects the direction: If I put my helm to the left or right, I luff or pull down. The sails affect propulsion: If I put a lot of sail area, I have a lot of power, I move faster. The weight of the crew affects the balance: If I put the weight on one side the boat heels more or less.</description></item></channel></rss>
