What happens when a dinghy accelerates and when it slows down?
Acceleration : wind speed (vv) that increases Slowing down: wind speed (vv) that decreases Close-up speed # Vectors
Vectors
Upwind, if you accelerate, the apparent wind increases and refuses.</description></item><item><title>Passing a reef</title><link>https://armandfardeau.github.io/dinghy-ffv4/en/docs/winds/gust_of_wind/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://armandfardeau.github.io/dinghy-ffv4/en/docs/winds/gust_of_wind/</guid><description>A reef is an increase in the actual wind. This chart can be taken the other way around for the passage of a squall (but we try to avoid them). A strengthening wind (while remaining stable in direction) makes the apparent wind increase. The boat&amp;rsquo;s objective is to take the most direct route.
Upwind Increasing force:
You shock a little - You maintain the course - bends. If the true wind is too strong, the apparent wind (will) give way without being able to hold the boat and one must then loaf or shock.</description></item></channel></rss>
